Help me find a set of flights.
I need to go from London to Toronto, departing between Dec 19-21.
Then I need to go from Toronto to San francisco departing between 27-29.
Then I want to go from San francisco to Oahu departing between 29-30 (spend minimum one night in San francisco).
Then I want to go from Oahu to Maui and Big Island. The order doesn't matter but I wanna depart from Oahu a few days later.
So basically spend a few days on Oahu, Maui and Big Island each.
Then fly back to San francisco Jan 6-8 and stay in San francisco 1-2 days and then fly back to Toronto and stay 2 days and then fly back to London and arrive by latest Jan 11 (or earlier).
All flights must be non stop.
