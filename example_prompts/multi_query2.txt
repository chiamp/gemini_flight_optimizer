I'm in London right now. I need to be in Cancun in a week.
I have friends in NYC and in Toronto that I wouldn't mind doing a stop-over for a few days if there are favorable flights in terms of price and duration of flight.
Find me the best flight plans for direct flights to Cancun, as well as flights to Cancun with stop-overs in Toronto and/or NYC.
The stop-overs can be 2-4 days ideally, but I'm flexible.
