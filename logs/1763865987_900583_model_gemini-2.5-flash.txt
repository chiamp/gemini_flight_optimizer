The current date is November 23rd, 2025. You mentioned wanting to fly from Toronto to NYC "in the next few days" and return on "November 22nd".
November 22nd, 2025, has already passed. Could you please clarify if you meant November 22nd, 2026, for your return date, or if you had a different departure timeframe in mind?
