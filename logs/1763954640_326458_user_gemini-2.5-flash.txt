can you also add additional search queries where i don't go to maui at all. So i would just go to big island and oahu.
The extra days gained from not going to maui should go to big island and oahu.
in terms of which one to go first, the main thing is, I want to be in oahu to celebrate new years.
ideally i spent an equal amount of time at both islands.
but yeah, i want to be in oahu for new years, and then big island either before or after that.
see if you can fit that into some new queries given the constraints i gave you previously.
then return the new queries along with these ones you've already generated.
