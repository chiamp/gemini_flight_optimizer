The user's instruction "remove min/max time spent in toronto" followed by "depart toronto in 5-7 days after arrival" is interpreted as confirming that there are no time-of-day constraints for arrival/departure in Toronto, and that the duration of stay in Toronto should still be between 5 and 7 days, which is precisely what `min_stay_hours` and `max_stay_hours` capture.

Based on the prompt:
1.  **Departure from London**: "flights as soon as possible". This will be interpreted as departing from tomorrow (2025-11-28) up to 3 days from now (2025-11-30).
2.  **Stay in Toronto**: "depart toronto in 5-7 days after arrival". This sets the `min_stay_hours` to 5 days (120 hours) and `max_stay_hours` to 7 days (168 hours) for Toronto.
3.  **Return to London**: "return to london in a week". This implies an approximate total trip duration. Given the explicit 5-7 day stay in Toronto and the "as soon as possible" departure, the return dates will be calculated based on these factors.
4.  **Flight constraints**: "maximum one layover stop" (`stops=MaxStops.ONE_STOP_OR_FEWER`) and "maximum flight time 10 hours total" (`max_duration=10*60` minutes) apply to both outbound and return flights.
5.  **No time constraints**: This implies no specific `TimeRange` for departure or arrival for any leg of the journey.

Let's calculate the date ranges:
*   **London departure**:
    *   `earliest`: 2025-11-28 (tomorrow)
    *   `latest`: 2025-11-30 (3 days from now)

*   **Toronto departure**:
    *   Assuming the flight from London to Toronto takes at most 1 day (max\_duration 10 hours),
        *   Earliest arrival in Toronto: 2025-11-28 (if depart London on 2025-11-28)
        *   Latest arrival in Toronto: 2025-12-01 (if depart London on 2025-11-30 and flight takes 1 day)
    *   Stay in Toronto for 5 to 7 days:
        *   Earliest departure from Toronto: 2025-11-28 (earliest arrival) + 5 days = 2025-12-03
        *   Latest departure from Toronto: 2025-12-01 (latest arrival) + 7 days = 2025-12-08

*   **London arrival (return)**:
    *   Assuming the flight from Toronto to London takes at most 1 day (max\_duration 10 hours),
        *   Earliest arrival in London: 2025-12-03 (if depart Toronto on 2025-12-03)
        *   Latest arrival in London: 2025-12-09 (if depart Toronto on 2025-12-08 and flight takes 1 day)
    *   The phrase "return to London in a week" will be treated as a general guideline, with the explicit stay duration and earliest departure taking precedence. The derived return window (Dec 3-9) aligns with a flexible interpretation of "in a week".
