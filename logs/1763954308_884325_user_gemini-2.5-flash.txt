arriving in london by jan 11th is more important.
maybe i can just spend two days in toronto.
and if it's still too tight, then take away a day from some of the hawaiian locations (if you need to take away more than a day, then make sure you distribute the removal evenly; i.e. don't take away two days from one hawaiian location before all the other locations have had one day removed)
