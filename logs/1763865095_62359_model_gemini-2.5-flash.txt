To help me suggest Asia trips from London, could you please provide more details on:

1.  **Specific destination(s) in Asia** you are interested in (e.g., Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, Dubai, etc.) or a region (e.g., Southeast Asia, East Asia).
2.  **Your preferred departure date range** from London (e.g., specific dates, or if "next few days" from our previous conversation still applies, please confirm).
3.  **Any other preferences or constraints**, such as:
    *   Maximum budget.
    *   Preferred number of stops (e.g., non-stop, one stop).
    *   Maximum flight duration.
    *   Preferred airlines.
    *   Any specific activities or interests for your trip (e.g., beaches, culture, food, city exploration).

Once I have this information, I can try to generate a specific flight query.
