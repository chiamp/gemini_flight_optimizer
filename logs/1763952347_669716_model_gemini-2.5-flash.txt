The user wants to arrive in London by January 11th at the latest. However, on the return trip, there's a segment from San Francisco to Toronto, and then Toronto to London, with a request to "stay in San Francisco 1-2 days" and "then fly back to Toronto for a few days".
Given that San Francisco to Toronto departs between Jan 8-11, the latest arrival in Toronto could be Jan 11. If you need to depart Toronto to arrive in London by Jan 11, this would only be possible with a very short or zero-day stay in Toronto (due to typical non-stop flight times from Toronto to London being approximately 7-8 hours). "A few days" typically implies 3-7 days.
Could you please clarify which constraint is more important:
1.  Arriving in London by January 11th.
2.  Spending "a few days" (3-7 days) in Toronto on the return journey.
If the London arrival date is firm, the stay in Toronto will likely be much shorter than "a few days".
