I noticed a potential contradiction in your request. You mentioned you want to "stay in San Francisco 1-2 days" after returning from Hawaii (arriving Jan 7-9), and then "fly back to Toronto for a few days" (which I've interpreted as at least 3 days). However, you also want to "fly back to London and arrive by latest Jan 11 (or earlier)".

Let's walk through the dates:
*   Latest arrival in San Francisco from Hawaii: Jan 9.
*   If you stay 1-2 days in San Francisco, the latest departure from San Francisco would be Jan 9 + 2 days = Jan 11.
*   Assuming a same-day non-stop flight from San Francisco to Toronto (unlikely due to time zones and distance, it would typically be an overnight flight or arrive the next calendar day), you would arrive in Toronto on Jan 11 or Jan 12.
*   If you were to arrive in Toronto on Jan 11, and then want to stay "a few days" in Toronto (e.g., 3 days), your earliest departure from Toronto would be Jan 11 + 3 days = Jan 14.
*   But you need to arrive in London by latest Jan 11.

This makes it impossible to fulfill both "stay a few days in Toronto" and "arrive in London by latest Jan 11" if your return journey from Hawaii starts on Jan 9.

Could you please clarify which constraint you'd prefer to prioritize or if you're open to adjusting the number of days for your stay in Toronto or the latest arrival date in London? For example:
1.  Are you flexible to arrive in London later (e.g., Jan 14-15)?
2.  Are you flexible to reduce the "few days" stay in Toronto to a shorter duration (e.g., just a transit stop with 0-24 hours layover)?
