I've outlined a detailed itinerary based on your request. There is one very tight constraint regarding your return journey:

You mentioned you want to "fly back to Toronto for a few days and then fly back to London and arrive by latest Jan 11 (or earlier)".
A non-stop flight from Toronto to London typically takes around 7-8 hours. This means to arrive in London by Jan 11, your flight from Toronto must depart no later than Jan 11.
However, you also stated you want to "stay in Toronto for a few days" after flying back from San Francisco. If "a few days" means 2 or more full days, it would be impossible to arrive in Toronto from San Francisco by Jan 9 (given the SFO departure window of Jan 8-11), stay for 2 days, and then depart for London by Jan 11.

To reconcile these, I have assumed that "a few days" in Toronto implies a very short stay or even an immediate connection, to prioritize your firm "arrive by latest Jan 11" constraint. If you strongly prefer a longer stay in Toronto (e.g., 2 full days), we would need to extend your latest arrival date back in London.

Could you please clarify your preference for the Toronto stay vs. the London arrival date?
